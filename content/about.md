<p>Since the beginning of 2016, I've been working continuously as a web developer full-time for different companies and as a freelance for different clients, currently, I'm working full-time for D4ALL, a Mexican web development company specializing in Drupal, located in Tepic, Nayarit. MÃ©xico.</p>

<h2>Why you should hire a freelance programmer for your project?</h2>
<p>I'm the freelance programmer you need for your project because during the past years I've been involved and sometimes in charge of significant projects for private and government entities from start to product launch as a developer, sysops, and as lead programmer.</p>

<p>An experienced freelancer  developer works with a given budget, and also optimizes the time coding with or without a given website design, also as a freelance developer it's level of adaptability is high, working alone or integrate with a developers team is not a problem.</p>

<h2>Hire programmers directly vs toptal, upwork, peopleperhour</h2>
<p>You don't have to wait for them to contact me and test my capabilities, I can talk with you directly and tell you my experience working with several technologies and real world projects, if you are a recruiter you can send me the project requirements.</p>

<p>I have proven experience in web development services, I'm a good candidate if you're looking to hire a great freelance developer which will take care of all the best sites practices and accessibility standards to complete your web project.</p>
