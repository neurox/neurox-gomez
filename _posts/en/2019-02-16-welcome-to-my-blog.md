Hello, first of all I explain why this mix of topics (programming, electronics and video games), it turns out that they are my greatest passions and I'm not sure which is the greatest of all.

First I wanted to make a blog that was more personal, in which I could publish problems or topics of interest of my day to day,
then I thought it would be better to make it professional, where I could publish things related to my work and what I do for lunch, but it's just that I've always liked to work in what I do for a living.
I have always liked to work in what I am passionate about, so these topics have always been related in my life, both personal and professional.
as well as professional.

So for the time being and until I change my mind, this will be a blog where I will publish everything I find interesting to share with other people who have the same interests.
I will try to publish frequently and varying the topics but I don't promise anything.

As for programming, my username in github is neurox and I am currently working as a full stack web developer, mainly working with PHP, MySQl, NodeJS, MongoDB and Firebase. But I'm already entering the Java world and soon I hope to get my first programming certification.

About video games, in the last few months I've been playing Playstation 4 full on Destiny, Destiny 2, Dying Light, Monster Hunter, The Division, if you're looking for someone to challenge my username is NeuroxGMZ.

And last but not least, in the world of electronics I dedicate my free time to repair computer equipment at the component level, most often laptops of any brand, including Apple, one or another cell phone, if you have any questions or need help with any equipment you can contact me at my email juanjose@ingomez.com.
